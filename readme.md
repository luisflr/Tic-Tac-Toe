# TIC TAC TOE

> Your challenge is to build out this Tic Tac Toe game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

> Your users should be able to:

> - View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
> - **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
> - **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win
> - Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
